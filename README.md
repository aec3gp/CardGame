# CardGame
Card Game called Golf

The idea of the project is to create a four person game of Golf the Card Game as an Android App. Within this github I have included
all of the code and images needed for the project. The rules of the game can be found at this link https://www.pagat.com/draw/golf.html. 
I will quickly explain the purpose of each class. The Card class if used to create the playing cards and adds in an equals method 
to evaluate each card. The Deck class controls all of the cards and draws the deck and the discard pile to the screen. User controls 
the moves and drawing of the users cards to the screen. PlayerOne, PlayerTwo, and PlayerThree all control the moves of the AI and 
drawing of their cards to the screen. The CardGame takes care of the entire gameplay.
